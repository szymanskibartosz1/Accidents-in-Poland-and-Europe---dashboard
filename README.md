## Accudents in Poland and Europe

The dashboard visualizes and allows for the analysis of data on road accidents in Poland and Europe. It consists of two main parts. One part includes a map and charts that show the number of accidents and casualties in individual provinces and counties. The other part compares Poland with other EU countries in terms of, among other things, accident mortality rates, road investments, and alcohol consumption.
